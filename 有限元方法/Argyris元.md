ExAMPLE 2.5 (The Argyris element). Let $K$ be a triangle in $\mathbb{R}^2, \mathcal{P}=P_5$ of dimension 21, $\mathcal{N}=$ the 21 degrees of freedom shown in Figure 2. "â€¢" denotes the evaluation at that point, the inner circle denotes the evaluation of the gradient at the center, the outer circle denotes the evaluation of three second derivatives at the center, and the arrows represent the evaluation of the normal derivatives at three midpoints.
